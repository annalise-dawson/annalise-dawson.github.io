    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h3>29 January 2025</h3>
    <h2>Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <p>
      During Dev Academy we were given a set of challenges and one of these
      challenges was called the flipflop. We were asked to write a function
      called flipflop that would take a number and simply return the number
      unless (and here's the hard part) if it was divisible by 3 - it should
      return flip, if it was divisible by 5 - it should return flop, and if it
      was divisible by 15 it should return flipflop.
    </p>
    <p>I originally wrote it like this:</p>
    <textarea cols="50" rows="14" readonly>
      
      export function flipflop(numberParameter) {

        if (numberParameter % 3 === 0) { 
        return 'Flip' 
        } else if (numberParameter % 5 === 0) {
        return 'Flop'
        } else if (numberParameter % 15 === 0) {
        return 'Flipflop'
        } else { 
        return numberParameter
        }
      }
    </textarea>
    <p>
      And I thought why the heck doesn't this work? It worked for numbers
      divisible by 3 and 5 but not 15. So I checked what the error was and it
      said that when there a number divisble by 15 it was returning flip.
      Hmmmmm? Lets rubber ducky this - if it's returning flip this must mean
      numbers divisble by 15 are getting the divisible by 3 if statement
      instead. Ahhhh I see it's becuase it's running through the function in the
      order I've written it. and obviously if it's divisble by 15 it's also
      divisble by 3! So all I need to do is put the if statement for numbers
      divisble by 15 at the start.
    </p>

    <textarea cols="50" rows="14" readonly>
      
      export function flipflop(numberParameter) {
          
        if (numberParameter % 15 === 0) {
        return 'FlipFlop' 
        } else if (numberParameter % 3 === 0) { 
        return 'Flip' 
        } else if (numberParameter % 5 === 0) { 
        return 'Flop'
        } else { 
        return numberParameter 
        }
      }
    </textarea>
    <p>
      And voila! It worked! Sometimes you've just got to think it all through.
      Think like the code, if you were this code how would you deal with a
      number divisible by 15?
    </p>
    <h2>Elegantly solving a problem</h2>
    <p>
      Another task we were given was to take a string, split the string into
      individual words and then filter out all the annoying buzzing sounds! The
      string looked something like this:
    </p>
    <textarea cols="90" rows="4" readonly>
      
      sentence = 'Buzz biZZ buZz help buzz BIZZ I'm being attacked by Bees! buzz BUZZ'
    </textarea>
    <p>
      So we needed to get rid of all the buzzing and just be left with 'Help I'm
      being attacked by bees!' I got to work and started by writing some
      pseudocode: <br />//Call the string <br />//Split the string into an array
      <br />//remove the buzz and bizz <br />//return the string without the
      buzz and bizz
    </p>
    <p>
      Great pseudocode Annalise! Now I went off and googled 'how to split a
      string into an array' and 'how to remove words from an array'. This gave
      me what I was looking for and I was ready to write some code!
    </p>
    <textarea cols="50" rows="8" readonly>
      
      function deBee(sentence) { 
        sentence.split(' ') 
        .filter((word)
        => word.includes('z')) 
        .join(' ')
      }
    </textarea>
    <p>
      Okay this isn't working at all where have I gone wrong D: The test error
      is giving me absolutely nothing. Well that's something. <br />I'm not
      making and new sentence or returning the sentence anywhere. Easy fix.
    </p>
    <textarea cols="50" rows="9" readonly>
      
      function deBee(sentence) { 
        let filteredSentence = sentence
        .split(' ') 
        .filter((word) => word.includes('z'))
        .join(' ')  
        return filteredSentence
      }
    </textarea>
    <p>
      Wait why the heck is it just 'Buzz biZZ buZz buzz BIZZ Bees! buzz BUZZ'.
      That's the oposite of what I want! Hmmm okay so lets google how to make it
      NOT include. Ahhh yes a simple ! at the start should do it!
    </p>
    <textarea cols="50" rows="9" readonly>
      
      function deBee(sentence) { 
        let filteredSentence = sentence
        .split(' ') 
        .filter((word) => !word.includes('z'))
        .join(' ')
        return filteredSentence
      }
    </textarea>
    <p>
      Okay we're getting somewhere but it's returned 'help BIZZ I'm being
      attacked by Bees! BUZZ'. It's those bloody capitals so lets try this.
    </p>
    <textarea cols="50" rows="9" readonly>
      
      function deBee(sentence) { 
        let filteredSentence = sentence
        .split(' ') 
        .filter((word) => !word.includes('z', 'Z'))
        .join(' ') 
        return filteredSentence
      }
    </textarea>
    <p>
      Nope didn't work! Lets have another google. I see so you can't just chuck
      a comma in and hope it works.
    </p>
    <textarea cols="50" rows="10" readonly>
     
      function deBee(sentence) { 
        let filteredSentence = sentence
        .split(' ') 
        .filter((word) => !word.includes('z') &&
        !word.includes('Z')) 
        .join(' ') 
        return filteredSentence 
      }
    </textarea>
    <p>
      And voila! It worked! I found here just trying something and reading the
      error message was the best way to it. And of course google is your best
      friend!
    </p>
    <h2>How confident I am with problem solving</h2>
    <p>
      I have given myself a score out of 10 for how confident I feel using the
      following techniques: 1 being I never do this but I really should and 10
      being I do this every time and it's great!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pseudocode - 7/10</li>

      <li>Reading error messages - 2/10</li>
      <li>Console.logging - 1/10</li>
      <li>Googling - 10/10</li>
      <li>Asking your peers for help - 5/10</li>
      <li>Asking coaches for help - 5/0</li>
      <li>Improving your process with reflection - 7/10</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Being reluctant to ask for help</h2>
    <p>
      I've definitely found myself hesitating to ask for help during the Dev
      Academy course. Mostly because I'm not always sure what exactly I need
      help with, and there's definitely a bit of embarrassment involved. I want
      to show someone my code and just ask, “Why isn't this working?” but then I
      get worried I'll look silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you know what? When it comes to coding, sometimes I really don't know
      what I'm doing, and that's okay. The only way I'm going to get better is
      by accepting that I need help sometimes. Plus, I'm sure there are plenty
      of people in the course feeling the same way.
