      <h1>The Difference Between Margin, Border, and Padding</h1>
      <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
        <p>
         Margin, border, and padding - what the heck does it mean 
         and why should you care? These three properties play a huge 
         role in how elements are spaced and displayed on your webpage. 
         Although they sound similar, they each have a distinct purpose, 
         and understanding the difference between them is key to 
         finessing the layout of your webpage.I'll break it down for you! 
        </p>
         <h2>Margin - Space Outside the Element</h2>
          <p>
              Think of margin as the space between your element and everything 
              else around it. If your element is like a box, the margin is 
              the empty space around the outside of that box. It's what 
              keeps your boxes (or other elements) from crowding each other.
          </p>

          <p>
              Imagine you have a box with some text in it. 
              The margin is the space between that box and 
              other boxes or the edges of the page. If you want 
              to push elements apart from each other, you use 
              margin. It helps create distance between different 
              sections of a page.
          </p>

          <h2>Border - The Edge of the Element</h2>

          <p>
            The border is like the outline or frame around your box. 
            It's the line that separates the inside of your box from 
            the outside world. You can make the border thick or thin, 
            change its color, or even make it dotted or dashed.
          </p>

          <p>You can use borders to define or highlight an element. 
            If you want to add some style to your box or make it 
            stand out more, borders are a good choice.
          </p>

          <h2>Padding - Space Inside the Box</h2>

          <p>
            Padding is the space between the content inside your 
            box (like text or images) and the border. If you have 
            a paragraph inside a box, padding is the space between 
            the text and the border of the box. It makes sure your 
            content isn't crammed right against the edges. 
          </p>
          
          <h2>Here's how they all look together</h2>
