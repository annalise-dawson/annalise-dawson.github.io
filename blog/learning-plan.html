    <h1>BOOTCAMP LEARNING PLAN</h1>
    <h3>February 2025</h3>
    <h2>Long term goal or career pathway</h2>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to grow into a skilled and impactful Software
      Developer, ultimately working my way into a leadership position. I want to
      find a workplace that aligns with my values and fosters a culture of
      growth, collaboration, and innovation. Over time, I envision myself in a
      role where I can lead a team, share my knowledge, and leave a lasting,
      positive impact on the tech community.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm particularly passionate about encouraging and inspiring more women to
      enter the tech industry, helping to create a more inclusive and diverse
      environment. I also dream of contributing to a major project that makes a
      meaningful difference in people's lives, solving real-world problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Top Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Honesty - helps me communicate openly and build trust within my team.
      </li>
      <li>Curiosity - drives continuous learning and growth.</li>
      <li>
        Adaptable & Flexible - easily adjust to new challenges and changing
        situations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Difficulty with Ambiguity - struggle when there's no clear direction or
        if things feel too chaotic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Imposter Syndrome - doubts about my abilities can sometimes make me feel
        like I don't belong or aren't worthy of success.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quiet Confidence - shyness keeps me from asserting myself or sharing my
        thoughts in group settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Problem-Solving - during my time in foundations I've found problem
        solving way more dificult than I thought it'd be and often don't know
        where to start.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Expectations for the Bootcamp team</h2>
    <p>
      I expect the Bootcamp team to bring a strong understanding of the
      material, along with patience and clear guidance. I'd also appreciate them
      being approachable and supportive, especially when things get challenging.
      I want my facilitators to feel comfortable giving me honest feedback and
      not make it awkward.
    </p>

    <h2>Expectations for myself</h2>
    <p>
      I'll keep communication clear and honest, letting people know what I'm
      working on and when they can expect things from me. I'll stay organized
      and positive, and be open to feedback from everyone. By staying flexible
      and approachable, I hope to create a collaborative and supportive vibe
      with my peers, facilitators, and anyone I work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      When things get overwhelming, I'll take a step back, break tasks down into
      smaller chunks, and tackle them one at a time. If it's still too much,
      I'll reach out for support from my homegroup or facilitator to get some
      perspective and advice. Taking short breaks to reset will help too, so I
      can stay focused and not burn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll give myself 20 minutes to try and solve a problem, if I'm still stuck
      after 20 minutes that's when I'll reach out to my homegroup in discord and
      if they can't help then my facilitator. I also have an experienced
      developer to lean on for support and I feel super comfortable asking them
      for help when I need it.
    </p>
