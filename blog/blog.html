        <h2>PROBLEM SOLVING</h2>
        <p>
          During Dev Academy we were given a set of challenges and one of these
          challenges was called the flipflop. We were asked to write a function
          called flipflop that would take a number and simply return the number
          unless (and here's the hard part)...

        <h2>NEUROPLASTICITY AND GROWTH MINDSET</h2>
        <p>
          I believe understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is
          incredibly empowering because it helps build confidence and gets rid
          of those doubts that you might not be born to do this...

        <p>
          Imagine you're building a car. HTML is like the frame and body of the
          car â€” it gives the car its basic structure and shape. Without a solid

        <h2>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
        <p>
          At its core, EQ is the ability to recognise, understand, and manage
          your emotions, and also understand how others are feeling. It involves
          five main things:...

          Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks

          I was once leading a team on a big project, and one of my teammates
          repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and contribute their share of

          Margin, border, and padding - what the heck does it mean and why
