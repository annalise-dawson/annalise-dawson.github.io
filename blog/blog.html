          I never realised that I've been stuck in a fixed mindset. I always
          thought you either had it or you didn't, and I wasn't convinced that I
          had it. Now I see how much a difference shifting to growth mindset can
          make...<a href="/blog/foundations-reflection.html">READ MORE</a>

          During Dev Academy we were given a set of challenges and one of these
          challenges was called the flipflop. We were asked to write a function
          called flipflop that would take a number and simply return the number
          unless (and here's the hard part)...<a

          I believe understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is

          Imagine you're building a car. HTML is like the frame and body of the
          car — it gives the car its basic structure and shape. Without a solid
