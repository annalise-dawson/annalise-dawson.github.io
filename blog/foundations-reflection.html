    <h1>FOUNDATIONS REFLECTION</h1>
    <h3>7 February 2025</h3>
    <h2>Three things I've learnt about myself</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I never realised that I've been stuck in a fixed mindset. I always
        thought you either had it or you didn't, and I wasn't convinced that I
        had it. Now I see how shifting to growth mindset can make all the
        difference.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Turns out, I'm not as good at thinking like a programmer as I thougt I'd
        be. It's humbling, but also makes sense - this kind of thinking takes
        practice, and I've gotta put in the work.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meditation has really shown me how loud my brain is. It's interesting
        how much mental chatter there is when I sit down in silence. But it's
        eye-opening and I think it's helping me become more aware of it.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming</h2>

    <p>
      Our values help us remember what's important and influence the way you
      code and learn. One of my values is curiosity and I reckon that helps me
      to dive into new coding techniques and take on difficult challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Empathy is really important in the learning process and coding as well.
      When you're coding with others, understanding someone else's perspective
      helps you learn better. It could mean understanding what your teammates
      need or even thinking like a user to design better code. Empathy also
      helps with feedback - when you understand where others are coming from,
      you're more open to actually taking that feedback on board.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being self-aware helps you figure out how you learn and code best. When
      you know your limitations, you can focus on improving them. It can also
      help when solving a problem and knowing when to push yourself or when to
      take a step back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Values, empathy and self-awareness helps us write better code, work more
      effectively in teams, and learn more.
    </p>

    <h2>The most surprising thing about the Human Skills leanring</h2>

    <p>
      I reckon the most surprising thing about the Human Skills learning is how
      much you don't know. There is so much going on in our brains when we're
      learning that we're not even aware of. Whether it's that little voice
      telling you you're not good enough or the literal neurons that are firing
      in your brain trying to connect it all. It's so mindblowing thinking about
      all these things happeing at the same time and effecting how fast we learn
      something and what actually sticks.
    </p>

    <p>
      And what's more surprising is that by learning about these Human Skills
      you can understand how to learn better and then ACTUALLY learn better.
      After learning about neuroplasticity I felt like I could feel the neurons
      start firing. I was so self-aware when information just wasn't getting
      through. And I could change what I was doing to make sure it did stick!
    </p>

    <h2>Challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning</h2>

    <p>
      For me the most challenging aspect of Human Skills learning is just
      believing it's worth the time and can actually have an impact. It's not
      like learning a new coding technique, you can't just watch a youtube
      video, understand how it all works and put it into practice. There's so
      many moving parts that you have to understand and work on overtime for it
      to actually have any effect. And there's no hard evidence of it working,
      like after watching a youtube video about a new coding technique you can
      take your learnings and write a peice of code, test it out and get it to
      do exactly what you want. There's hard evidence that you learnt the new
      coding technique, human skills doesn't work like that. But behind all that
      code you wrote there is all the human skills you learnt along the way you
      just can't see it written in the code.
    </p>

    <h2>Why are we focusing on this at Dev Academy?</h2>
    <p>
      Great coders are made not only by their technical knowledge but also by
      the human skills they bring to the table. Of course, knowing how to write
      code and understanding how it works is essential, but the soft skills that
      happen behind the scenes are just as important. These are often invisible,
      but they are crucial. At Dev Academy, they're all about getting you a job
      afterward, and without those human skills, landing that job becomes way
      harder. You might ace the coding test, but if you can't articulate your
      weaknesses or handle real-world challenges, you're at a disadvantage.
    </p>
    <h2>Was this all a waste of time?</h2>
    <p>
      I don't think it was a waste of time at all. In the long run learning
      human skills probably actually saved me time. If I had just focused on
      coding without understanding how to approach learning, I would've spent
      way more time struggling and getting stuck. The human skills I learned
      helped me break down problems better, communicate more clearly, and
      understand how I learn best.
