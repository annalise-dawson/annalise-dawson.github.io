    <h1>Values and Identity</h1>
    <h2>A Tough Call</h2>
    <p>
      I was once leading a team on a big project, and one of my teammates
      repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and contribute their share of work.
      The team was getting frustrated, and the project was starting to fall
      behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      The core values I weighed here were fairness and accountability. I wanted
      to be fair to the rest of the team, who were working hard, but I also knew
      I needed to be compassionate toward the teammate struggling with their
      responsibilities. I considered whether I should cover for them or confront
      the issue head-on, which could risk creating tension within the group.
    </p>

    <p>
      I decided to have a private conversation with my teammate. I asked if they
      needed help with their tasks and if there was something affecting their
      ability to contribute. It turned out they were dealing with personal
      issues that I wasn't aware of. I spoke to the group about the situation,
      and we reallocated some tasks to lighten their load.
    </p>

    <p>
      This decision worked well because it balanced compassion with
      accountability. I learned that it's important to address the situation
      directly but with empathy, rather than making assumptions. In hindsight, I
      would have spoken up earlier to offer support before things started to
      fall apart.
    </p>

    <h2>Influence</h2>

    <p>
      Growing up my Poppa was the hardest working man I knew. He worked up until
      the ripe old age of 90 years old. And it wasn't out of necessity, it was
      just because he loved to get shit done (he probably wouldn't phrase it
      that way). He prided himself on his work from the potatoes he grew in the
      garden to the grounds he maintained at the local golf club (could you get
      anymore grandfathery?). His true value was showing up everyday and giving
      it your all - and that rubbed off on me. This might sound made up but I
      swear it's not! My manager once said “Annalise's work ethic and efficiency
      could rival that of the ants in Pixar's A Bug's Life”.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quote that has always stuck with me is, “If it's your job to eat a frog,
      it's best to do it first thing in the morning,” That's how I approach life
      - take on the toughest challenges first. Poppa always did, and I've
      learned that starting with the hard stuff makes everything else feel
      easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people around me also taught me to value kindness, and one mantra I
      carry with me is, “Always try kindness first.” Showing empathy and
      understanding is just as important as hard work and kindness goes a long
      way.
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Honesty - I value being open and truthful, both with myself and others.
        This will help me stay grounded and self-aware throughout my learning
        journey, ensuring I'm honest about my progress, challenges, and areas
        where I need improvement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Curiosity - My natural curiosity drives me to explore and dig deeper
        into topics that interest me. This will keep me engaged and motivated to
        continuously learn and grow, allowing me to find enjoyment in the
        process and not just the end result. I'll actively seek out new ideas
        and experiences, which will help me expand my knowledge and
        understanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adaptable & flexible - I'm comfortable adjusting to new situations and
        challenges, which is crucial when learning something new. Whether it's
        shifting focus, exploring new methods, or navigating unexpected
        obstacles, my ability to adapt will help me stay resilient and keep
        moving forward even when things don't go as planned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Logical problem-solver - My approach to learning will be shaped by
        clear, logical thinking. I'll break down complex concepts into
        manageable steps and develop strategies to overcome challenges. This
        will help me stay focused, solve problems efficiently, and keep track of
        the bigger picture, ensuring I make steady progress toward my goals.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Difficulty with ambiguity - I struggle when there's no clear direction,
        which can make it hard to stay focused. I'll need to break tasks into
        smaller steps and ASK QUESTIONS when things aren't clear
      </li>
      <li>
        Imposter syndrome - Sometimes, I have doubts about my abilities, which
        makes me feel like I don't belong or that I'm not worthy of success.
        This can hold me back from fully embracing opportunities or speaking up
        in class. Just gotta remind myself of my strengths and seek support to
        stay confident in my progress.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quiet confidence - My shyness can make it difficult for me to assert
        myself or share my thoughts in group settings. This may prevent me from
        fully contributing to discussions or asking for help when I need it. I
        really should speak up more and practice being confident in expressing
        my ideas.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tension in the Group</h2>
    <p>
      So, we were in the middle of launching a product update, and the tech team
      was eager to push it live - except we hadn't gotten the green light from
      legal yet. I raised the concern, and naturally, this did not go over well
      with the tech team. It caused a big delay and messed with everyone's
      calendars, especially with the holidays coming up. One team was pushing to
      move forward without legal approval, while the other (including myself)
      felt strongly that we needed to follow the proper process. It got pretty
      messy with key stakeholders about to go on leave, and the back-and-forth
      created a lot of stress between teams.
    </p>

    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open communication and accountability - I owned up to my part in not
        involving legal sooner and explained that, even though I didn't want the
        delay either, it was necessary to follow the rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clear timeline and delegation - I put together a timeline of the
        process, showing how long everything would take and who needed to be
        involved at each step. This helped everyone understand the bigger
        picture and what was required.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborative problem-solving - I asked each team to list what they
        needed from others to make the process run smoothly. This ensured we had
        everything in place and that no one was left out of the loop.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The plan helped reduce some of the tension by making everything more
      transparent and organised. We still had some frustration, but once
      everyone knew the timeline and their responsibilities, it was easier to
      move forward. We eventually got the legal approval, and pushed the changes
      just before the code freeze.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, I would obviously make sure to involve legal much earlier in
      the process to avoid delays like this. But I think my biggest faux pas was
      that I didn't speak up sooner because I worried what happened would
      happen. This just made it worse and caused even longer delays (facepalm).
      Owning up to my mistakes landed really well, it stopped people focusing on
      whose fault it was and got us all back to the task at hand - being open is
      always a great strategy! Forward planning is also key - you might not be
      able to predict what issues you're going to face but giving yourself a
      buffer in case anything goes wrong is important.
