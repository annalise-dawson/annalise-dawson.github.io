    <h1>What the heck is EQ and why the heck should you care?</h1>
    <h3>21 January 2025</h3>
    <h2>What is EQ?</h2>
    <p>
      At its core, EQ is the ability to recognise, understand, and manage your
      emotions, and also understand how others are feeling. It involves five
      main things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Self-awareness - Knowing how you feel and why.</li>
      <li>
        Self-regulation -Keeping your emotions in check, especially in stressful
        situations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Motivation - Having an inner drive to achieve goals and stay focused.
      </li>
      <li>
        Empathy - Understanding how others feel, even when they don't say it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Social skills - Building good relationships and working well with
        others.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How is EQ different from IQ?</h2>
    <p>
      IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is what we traditionally think of when we hear
      "intelligence" â€” it's all about logic, problem-solving, and academic
      smarts. EQ, on the other hand, is about handling emotions and navigating
      social situations. While IQ helps you solve problems, EQ helps you connect
      with people, manage stress, and lead teams.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <p>
      Having high EQ can significantly improve your relationships, as it allows
      you to understand and connect with others on a deeper level. It also helps
      you stay calm and manage stress better when things get hectic. People with
      strong EQ make great leaders because they can motivate their teams and
      understand their needs, while also resolving conflicts in a calm,
      constructive way. In short, EQ is a game-changer - it helps you build
      stronger relationships, succeed at work, and feel more in control of your
      emotions.
