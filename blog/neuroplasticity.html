    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h3>27 January 2025</h3>
    <h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
    <p>
      I believe understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is incredibly
      empowering because it helps build confidence and gets rid of those doubts
      that you might not be born to do this. Knowing that our brains have the
      ability to change and grow through effort gives us a sense of control over
      our learning. It's not about having natural talent; it's about actively
      rewiring your brain to get better at something. The more we practice and
      repeat what we've learned, the easier it becomes to keep that knowledge
      locked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It feels very meta learning about neuroplasticity while trying to pick up
      a new skill. But you're sending a clear message to your brain: “I'm
      serious about this. Let's create new pathways.” And in a way, your brain
      might be more willing to adapt because it knows you're intentionally
      working to shape it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
      benefit
    </h2>
    <p>
      From what I've come across in my research, one of the most important
      factors in boosting neuroplasticity is sustained, focused attention. When
      you give something your full focus, you're telling your brain that it's
      important and worth remembering. So for me, I plan to code every day -
      whether that's through my course or just on my own. This ties into the
      idea of “use it or lose it” and “use it and improve it” - the more we
      practice, the more our brain adapts and strengthens those connections.
    </p>
    <h2>Ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>
      From my research, I've found that strengthening neural connections isn't
      just about what you do while you're studying - it's also about what you do
      outside of that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Movement helps get blood flowing to the brain and stimulates the release
      of neurotrophic factors like BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor).
      These factors promote the growth of new neurons and enhance brain
      connections, helping your brain stay flexible and better able to learn new
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep is when your brain does a lot of its important work. It processes
      the information you've learned, deciding where to store it and how to link
      it together. If you don't get enough sleep - say, less than 7 hours - your
      brain won't have the time it needs to reorganise everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meditation is a powerful tool for increasing neuroplasticity. It's a way
      of consciously training your brain to think differently and shift its
      patterns. Visualisation, which is a type of meditation, can be especially
      effective because it taps into emotion - a key factor in neuroplasticity.
      For example, by visualising myself as a Software Developer working on
      impactful projects, I'm not just setting a goal, I'm also creating an
      emotional connection to it, which makes it more likely to stick. Plus,
      meditation helps reduce neural noise and improves focus, making it easier
      to concentrate on learning.
    </p>
    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve your abilities and
      intelligence through effort, learning, and persistence. This mindset is
      essential because if you don't believe in your ability to grow, you might
      feel like your potential is capped. Believing that your abilities can
      develop over time is empowering - it means you can achieve whatever you
      set your mind to if you're willing to put in the work.
    </p>
    <h2>The Surpises of a Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      I'm surprised that I had such a fixed mindset without even realising it. I
      thought my abilities were limited or set in stone and that I just wasn't
      as smart as other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it's so easy to shift that thinking. A growth mindset is a very
      logical way of thinking. Going from seeing failure as something to avoid,
      to understanding that failure is a natural part of life and an opportunity
      for growth, isn't difficult to grasp. We often want to nail a task on the
      first try, but when you really think about it, that's just not how it
      works. Most people know that, yet we still feel frustrated when things
      don't go as planned. Why do we expect everything to be easy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing I've noticed is how I can shy away from feedback, often
      because it feels personal or too critical. But feedback is actually an
      incredible opportunity to learn and improve. I would much rather know if
      I'm doing something wrong or if there's a better way to do it, rather than
      continuing with the same habits and not realising there's room for growth.
      Avoiding feedback might feel safer in the moment, but it's way more
      embarrassing to find out later that you could have improved.
    </p>
    <h2>Integrating a Growth Mindset into my Learning Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Embrace Challenges - I want to actively seek out challenges, even if I'm
      not sure I have all the skills to succeed right away. I know that I can
      always learn new things as I go, and challenges are a great way to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Focus on Effort - If my webpage doesn't look exactly as I imagined it,
      that doesn't mean I haven't put in the effort. I've still learned a lot
      along the way, and every bit of effort counts toward progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learn from Mistakes - It's completely okay to fail. In fact, if I'm too
      scared to fail, I won't make progress. Mistakes are part of the process,
      and they help me learn more than any success could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Persistent - If I feel like I've “failed,” that's not a reason to
      give up. It's actually the perfect reason to keep going and push through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celebrate Progress - I'm constantly taking in new information, and it's
      important to celebrate the small wins. It might not all make sense at
      first, but over time, it will come together. And that's the whole point -
      learning is a journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seek Feedback - Feedback isn't about feeling ashamed of my work; it's an
      opportunity to get better. Asking for feedback from facilitators and peers
      will help me grow, not hold me back. Embracing feedback is a sign that I'm
      committed to improving.
