    <h1>JAVASCRIPT AND THE DOM</h1>
    <h3>24 January 2024</h3>

    <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine you're building a car. HTML is like the frame and body of the car
      â€” it gives the car its basic structure and shape. Without a solid frame,
      the car wouldn't have a proper foundation to build upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS, on the other hand, is like the paint job, the wheels, and everything
      that gives the car its 'look'. It makes the car look good, but it doesn't
      make it run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, JavaScript is the engine. It's what makes the car actually move, and
      change speed when you press the gas pedal. Without JavaScript, the car
      would just sit there, looking good but not going anywhere. JavaScript
      brings the interactivity and functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Control Flow and Loops in JavaScript</h2>

    <p>
      Control flow is the order in which a program runs. It's like following a
      set of instructions that can change depending on the situation. For
      example, you might tell your program to do one thing if a condition is
      true, and something else if it's not. It's like asking: "If it's raining,
      take an umbrella. If it's sunny, wear sunglasses."
    </p>

    <p>
      Loops are helpful when you need to repeat a task multiple times. Say you
      have a list of items you want to display on a webpage, you could use a
      loop to show each item without having to write the same code over and
      over. Instead of telling the program to do something for each item
      manually, a loop allows it to repeat the task automatically for every item
      in the list.
    </p>

    <h2>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>

    <p>
      Now that we know how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS let's talk
      about the DOM! When building a webpage, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM
      each have an important role in bringing everything together.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DOM (Document Object Model) acts as a bridge between the webpage and
      JavaScript. It's an internal, live representation of your HTML structure
      that the browser uses. When the webpage loads, the DOM is created based on
      your HTML content. JavaScript then interacts with the DOM to manipulate
      the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's say you have a button on a page and when you click it the background
      colour of the page changes. In the background HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
      the DOM are all working together to make this happen.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The button is defined in HTML and given the id 'myButton'.</li>
      <li>
        The colour of this button and the size of the button is styled with CSS.
        Inside the CSS we'll also have the colour of the typical background and
        the colour of the background when it's pushed.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript is listening for the click using .addEventListener() and runs
        a function to change the background colour of the page when the button
        is clicked.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript is using the DOM to find the button and change the background
        colour. Using document.querySelector('#myButton'), JavaScript can target
        the button, then update the background colour when the button is
        clicked.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to access data from arrays and how to access data from objects</h2>

    <p>
      Firstly, what's the difference between arrays and objects? Well they're
      both ways of storing data but they're used a little differently. An array
      is an ordered list written like this:
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">
      Let sonicCharacters = ['sonic', 'tails', 'DrRobotnik']
    </p>

    <p>
      In an array, each item has a numeric index starting from 0. So,
      sonicCharacters[0] is "sonic", sonicCharacters[1] is "tails", and
      sonicCharacters[2] is "DrRobotnik".
    </p>

    <p>
      An object stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. It looks like
      this:
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">
      Let sonicCharacters = {
      <br />main: 'sonic', <br />bestFriend: 'tails', <br />enemy:'DrRobotnik'
      <br />}
    </p>

    <p>
      In an object, each piece of data has a key (like main, bestFriend, enemy)
      and a corresponding value (like sonic, tails, DrRobotnik). The key helps
      you access the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get data from an array, you refer to the index of the item you want.
      Since arrays are ordered, the first item has an index of 0. I want to
      console.log Sonic (because they're my favourite). So I'll write:
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">console.log(sonicCharacters[0])</p>

    <p>
      To get data from an object, you use the key associated with the value. The
      key is like a label that helps you find the data you need. To see sonic I
      would need the write:
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">console.log(sonicCharacters.name)</p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p>
      A function in JavaScript is like a little "tool" that does a specific job.
      You can use it whenever you need it, instead of writing the same code over
      and over. It's super handy for organising your code and making it easier
      to read. For example:
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">
      function praiseSonic() {
      <br />console.log('Sonic is my hero!'); <br />}
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, whenever you want to say "Sonic is my hero!" you just call
      praiseSonic() instead of writing the console.log() every time. This isn't
      a great example because it's not that hard to type console.log('Sonic is
      my hero!') but you can write some pretty complex functions so you get the
      point right?
