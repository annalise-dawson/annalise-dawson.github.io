# My First Blog 🌱
This is my very first web project built using HTML and CSS during my time at Dev Academy. It’s a simple personal blog that reflects the early stages of my journey into web development.

# 📖 About
This project was created as part of the Foundations phase at Dev Academy. The goal was to practice writing HTML and applying basic CSS to structure and style a webpage.

The blog includes:

A homepage with a personal introduction

Several blog posts written during the course

Links to navigate between pages

Custom styling using an external CSS file
