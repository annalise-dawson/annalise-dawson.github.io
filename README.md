# My First App ðŸŒ±
This is my very first web app built using HTML and CSS during my time at Dev Academy. Itâ€™s a simple personal blog that reflects the early stages of my journey into web development.

# ðŸ“– About
This project was created as part of the Foundations phase at Dev Academy. The goal was to practice writing HTML and applying basic CSS to structure and style a webpage.

The blog includes:

A homepage with a personal introduction

Several blog posts written during the course

Links to navigate between pages

Custom styling using an external CSS file
